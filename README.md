Spawned from a Twitter thread, this is a work-in-progress map highlighting
publicly available bike parking in and around the Halifax peninsula.

![Map Preview](./static/preview.png)

The map aims to be an detailed view of bike parking inventory. This means
street-level positioning and labelling of bike racks into appropriate
categories, with the intent that when someone on a bike is planning a route,
they can have clarity as to how, and if, they can safely lock up their bicycle.

This repository includes the `.geojson` file which is a regular export of the
map details.

## Further Work

In addition to being a potentially useful utility, the data contained within
this map may serve as a means of advocacy. Some ideas:

* Analysing bike parking facilities on retail strips
* Identifying inconsistent or unusable (e.g wheel slot) inventory
* Identifying infrastructure that needs repair
* Etc..
